## Detailed Implementation

### 5.1 Photo Capture Method
```dart
Future<void> _capturePhoto() async {
  if (!_controller.value.isInitialized) return;
  
  try {
    setState(() => _isCapturing = true);
    
    // Track orientation at capture time
    final orientation = await _getDeviceOrientation();
    
    final XFile photo = await _controller.takePicture();
    
    // Save with orientation metadata
    await _savePhotoWithMetadata(photo, orientation);
    
    _showCaptureSuccess();
  } catch (e) {
    _showCaptureError(e.toString());
  } finally {
    setState(() => _isCapturing = false);
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Orientation Tracking
```dart
class OrientationCapture {
  static Future<OrientationData> getCurrentOrientation() async {
    return OrientationData(
      deviceOrientation: await SystemChrome.orientation,
      timestamp: DateTime.now(),
      magnetometerReading: await sensors.magnetometer.first,
    );
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Photo Metadata Structure
```dart
class PhotoMetadata {
  final String deviceOrientation;
  final DateTime capturedAt;
  final String cameraLens; // front/rear
  final String resolution;
  final String deviceModel;
  final String androidVersion;
  final String appVersion;
}
```

### 5.4 Photo Capture UI
```dart
Widget _buildNativePhotoCaptureButton() {
  return GestureDetector(
    onTap: _isCapturing ? null : _capturePhoto,
    child: Container(
      width: 70,
      height: 70,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        shape: BoxShape.circle,
        color: Colors.white,
        border: Border.all(
          color: _isCapturing 
            ? Colors.grey.withOpacity(0.3) 
            : Colors.white.withOpacity(0.3), 
          width: 4
        ),
      ),
      child: Center(
        child: AnimatedContainer(
          duration: Duration(milliseconds: 150),
          width: _isCapturing ? 45 : 50,
          height: _isCapturing ? 45 : 50,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
            color: _isCapturing ? Colors.grey : Colors.white,
          ),
          child: _isCapturing 
            ? SizedBox(
                width: 20,
                height: 20,
                child: CircularProgressIndicator(
                  strokeWidth: 2,
                  valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.black),
                ),
              )
            : Icon(Icons.camera_alt, color: Colors.black, size: 24),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}

// Native-style orientation indicator overlay
Widget _buildOrientationIndicator() {
  return Positioned(
    top: 50,
    right: 20,
    child: Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8, vertical: 4),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
      ),
      child: Row(
        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
        children: [
          Icon(Icons.screen_rotation, color: Colors.white, size: 16),
          SizedBox(width: 4),
          Text(
            _getCurrentOrientationText(),
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 12),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Critical Orientation Testing

### Test Matrix for Photo Capture
For each device orientation, capture multiple photos and verify:

#### Portrait Upright
- [ ] Capture photo in portrait upright position
- [ ] Verify EXIF orientation tag is correct
- [ ] Check image displays correctly in gallery
- [ ] Verify image opens correctly in external apps

#### Landscape Left (USB port right)
- [ ] Capture photo in landscape left position
- [ ] Verify EXIF orientation compensates for rotation
- [ ] Check image auto-rotates correctly in viewers
- [ ] Test with both front and rear cameras

#### Landscape Right (USB port left)
- [ ] Capture photo in landscape right position
- [ ] Verify EXIF orientation metadata
- [ ] Confirm proper rotation in gallery apps
- [ ] Test across different camera resolutions

#### Portrait Upside Down
- [ ] Capture photo upside down (if supported)
- [ ] Verify orientation handling edge case
- [ ] Check for proper EXIF rotation data
- [ ] Test system gallery display

### Metadata Verification
```dart
class PhotoVerification {
  static Future<bool> verifyOrientation(String photoPath) async {
    // Read EXIF data
    // Compare with expected orientation
    // Verify image displays correctly
  }
}
```
