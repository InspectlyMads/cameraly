# Task 3: Gallery Screen Implementation

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH (Critical for orientation verification)  
**Estimated Completion:** 2.5 hours  
**Actual Completion:** 2.5 hours

## Objective

Implement a gallery screen that allows users to view captured photos and videos within the app, specifically to verify that orientation metadata is correctly applied. This serves as the primary verification tool before testing in native device gallery apps.

## Success Criteria

1. âœ… Gallery displays all captured photos and videos in a grid layout
2. âœ… Photos display with correct orientation (no manual rotation needed)
3. âœ… Videos play with correct orientation and show thumbnails
4. âœ… Users can delete individual media files for cleanup
5. âœ… Navigation from camera screen to gallery works seamlessly
6. âœ… Empty state handled gracefully when no media exists
7. âœ… Performance optimized for large numbers of media files

## Implementation Breakdown

### Core Components to Create/Modify

1. **GalleryScreen.dart** - Main gallery interface
2. **MediaService** - Handle media file operations and metadata
3. **Gallery Providers** - Riverpod providers for media state management
4. **MediaItem Model** - Data structure for captured media
5. **Video Player Integration** - Handle video preview and playback
6. **Navigation Updates** - Add gallery access from camera screen

### Key Data Structures

```dart
enum MediaType { photo, video }

class MediaItem {
  final String path;
  final MediaType type;
  final DateTime capturedAt;
  final String? orientationData;
  final String? thumbnailPath;
  final Duration? videoDuration;
}

class GalleryState {
  final List<MediaItem> mediaItems;
  final bool isLoading;
  final String? errorMessage;
  final MediaItem? selectedItem;
}
```

### Architecture

- Video metadata display (duration, resolution)

### 3.3 Video Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of video thumbnails
- Memory management for video players
- Proper disposal of video controllers

## Phase 4: Media Management & Polish (30 min)

### 4.1 Delete Functionality
- Individual media deletion
- Confirmation dialogs
- Batch selection and deletion
- File system cleanup

### 4.2 Metadata Display
- Show capture time and date
- Display orientation data when available
- File size and resolution information
- Camera lens information (front/back)

### 4.3 UI Polish & Accessibility
- Material 3 design consistency
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessibility labels and semantics
- Error handling and user feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (12 tests)
- MediaService file operations
- Media discovery and metadata reading
- File deletion and cleanup
- State management providers

### Widget Tests (8 tests)
- GalleryScreen UI rendering
- Photo grid display
- Video thumbnail display
- Delete confirmation dialogs

### Integration Tests (6 tests)
- End-to-end gallery navigation
- Photo/video display accuracy
- Delete functionality workflow
- Navigation between camera and gallery

### Orientation Verification Tests
- **Critical:** Verify photos taken in different orientations display correctly
- **Critical:** Verify videos recorded in different orientations play correctly
- **Comparison:** Test same media in device native gallery app
- **Documentation:** Record orientation test results for analysis

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies
- `video_player: ^2.8.2` - For video playback and thumbnails
- `path: ^1.8.3` - For file path operations

### Existing Dependencies
- Camera package (for media file format understanding)
- Path provider (for file system access)
- Riverpod (for state management)

## Potential Challenges

1. **Video Thumbnail Generation:** Creating efficient thumbnails for video files
2. **Memory Management:** Handling large numbers of photos/videos without memory issues
3. **File System Performance:** Efficiently scanning for media files
4. **Video Player Lifecycle:** Proper disposal of video controllers
5. **Orientation Verification:** Ensuring media displays correctly without manual intervention
6. **Platform Differences:** Handling different media formats across Android versions

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance Issues:** Implement lazy loading and pagination for large media collections
- **Memory Leaks:** Proper disposal patterns for video controllers and image widgets
- **File Access Errors:** Comprehensive error handling for file system operations
- **Orientation Problems:** Extensive testing and fallback display options

## Deliverables

1. Fully functional GalleryScreen with photo and video support
2. MediaService with complete file management capabilities
3. Video player integration with thumbnail generation
4. Comprehensive orientation verification testing
5. Delete functionality with proper cleanup
6. Navigation integration with camera screen
7. Documentation of orientation verification results
