## Device Testing Matrix

### Planned Test Devices
- [ ] **Primary Device:** [Device Name/Model]
- [ ] **Secondary Device:** [Device Name/Model]
- [ ] **Older Android:** [Device with older Android version]
- [ ] **Different Manufacturer:** [Non-primary manufacturer device]

### Per-Device Testing Checklist
For each device, verify:
- [ ] App builds and installs successfully
- [ ] Camera permissions granted properly
- [ ] Camera preview renders correctly
- [ ] Photo capture works in all orientations
- [ ] Video recording works in all orientations
- [ ] Media displays correctly in device gallery
- [ ] EXIF/video metadata is accurate

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Device-Specific Camera Behavior** 
   - Risk: Different manufacturers handle orientation differently
   - Mitigation: Test on multiple device brands early

2. **EXIF Metadata Reliability**
   - Risk: Camera package may not set orientation correctly
   - Mitigation: Implement manual metadata verification

3. **Video Orientation Complexity**
   - Risk: Video metadata more complex than photos
   - Mitigation: Extensive video testing with multiple players

### Contingency Plans
- If orientation metadata fails: Implement manual rotation detection
- If camera package issues: Consider alternative camera libraries
- If timeline slips: Prioritize photo testing over video

---
