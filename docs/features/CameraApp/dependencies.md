## Version Strategy
- **Current versions**: All versions updated for June 2025 compatibility
- **Flutter compatibility**: Minimum Flutter 3.16.0 for latest camera features and Dart 3.2 support
- **SDK compatibility**: Dart 3.2+ for latest language features and performance improvements
- **Update strategy**: Regular dependency updates with testing validation
- **Breaking changes**: All packages vetted for API stability and migration paths

## Security Considerations
- All dependencies from verified publishers
- Regular security audits with `flutter pub deps --style=compact`
- No dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- Minimal external dependencies for reduced attack surface
- Updated to latest security patches available in 2025
