- **Flutter compatibility**: Using Flutter 3.27.3 with Dart 3.6.1
- **SDK compatibility**: Dart 3.6+ for latest language features and performance
- **Proven stability**: All packages are stable releases, not pre-release versions
- **Upgrade path**: Ready for `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` when needed

## Security Considerations
- All dependencies from verified publishers
- Regular security audits with `flutter pub deps --style=compact`
- No dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- Minimal external dependencies for reduced attack surface
- Updated to latest security patches available in June 2025
- Camera package includes latest Android security improvements
