- âœ… Created `CameraPreviewUtils` class for proper aspect ratio calculations
- âœ… Replaced `Positioned.fill()` with calculated preview sizing
- âœ… Added centered preview with bezels showing exact capture area
- âœ… Implemented bezel pattern painter to indicate non-capture areas
- âœ… Enhanced preview with borders, shadows, and rounded corners
- âœ… Support for various screen aspect ratios and orientations

### Task 11: Camera Lens Switching Fix âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours | **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: Front camera toggle button doesn't work - can't access selfie camera.

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Fixed type conflicts between custom and camera package enums
- âœ… Enhanced camera service with proper lens direction mapping
- âœ… Added comprehensive debugging logs for camera discovery
- âœ… Improved state management with loading states and error handling
- âœ… Enhanced UI with proper camera icons and user feedback
- âœ… Added retry logic for camera switching failures

### Task 12: Enhanced Flash Controls âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours | **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: Need proper Auto/On/Off modes for photos, On/Off only for video.

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Created separate `PhotoFlashMode` (Off/Auto/On) and `VideoFlashMode` (Off/Torch) enums
- âœ… Implemented context-aware flash controls based on camera mode
- âœ… Added flash state persistence across mode switches
- âœ… Enhanced service with mode-specific flash management
- âœ… Hide flash controls when front camera active (no flash hardware)
- âœ… Improved flash mode icons and display names

### Task 13: Orientation-Specific UI Layouts âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours | **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: Capture button needs to be right-center instead of bottom-center for better ergonomics in landscape.

**Solution Implemented**:
- âœ… Created `OrientationUIHelper` utility for position calculations
- âœ… Implemented separate `PortraitCameraOverlay` and `LandscapeCameraOverlay` components
- âœ… Moved capture button to right-center in landscape for thumb accessibility
- âœ… Added smooth orientation transition animations
- âœ… Enhanced UI zones calculation for optimal control placement
- âœ… Improved ergonomics with orientation-specific button sizing

## Phase 5 Summary âœ… COMPLETED

**Total Implementation Time**: ~8-12 hours
**All Critical Issues Resolved**: âœ…

### Key Achievements:
1. **Camera Preview Accuracy**: Users now see exactly what will be captured
2. **Full Camera Functionality**: Both front and back cameras work reliably
3. **Professional Flash Controls**: Context-aware flash modes for photos and videos
4. **Optimized Ergonomics**: Landscape mode optimized for natural thumb positioning
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Smooth transitions, proper feedback, and intuitive controls

### Technical Improvements:
- Advanced aspect ratio calculations and preview centering
- Robust camera switching with comprehensive error handling
- Context-aware flash system with separate photo/video modes
- Orientation-specific UI layouts with smooth transitions
- Enhanced state management and user feedback systems

**Status**: All Phase 5 tasks completed successfully. The camera app now provides a professional, native-like experience with accurate preview, reliable camera switching, proper flash controls, and optimized ergonomics across all orientations.

## Data Structures

### CameraMode Enum
```dart
enum CameraMode {
  photosOnly,
  videosOnly,
  photosAndVideos
}
```

### MediaItem Model
```dart
class MediaItem {
  final String path;
  final MediaType type;
  final DateTime capturedAt;
  final String orientation;
}
```

## Critical Orientation Considerations

1. **Camera Preview Rendering:** Ensure preview adapts correctly to device rotation
2. **Capture Metadata:** Verify EXIF/video metadata contains correct orientation info
3. **UI Overlay Positioning:** Camera controls must remain usable in all orientations
4. **Lifecycle Management:** Camera state preservation during app transitions

## Potential Challenges

1. **Device-Specific Quirks:** Different Android manufacturers may handle camera orientation differently
2. **Permission Complexity:** Modern Android permission models require careful handling
3. **Video Orientation:** Video metadata handling can be more complex than photos
4. **Memory Management:** Proper camera controller disposal to prevent memory leaks
5. **Testing Coverage:** Need access to multiple Android devices for comprehensive testing

## Testing Strategy

### Orientation Matrix Testing
For each capture mode, test all four orientations:
- Portrait Upright
- Landscape Left (USB port right)
- Landscape Right (USB port left)
- Portrait Upside Down

### Verification Points
1. In-app gallery display
2. Native device gallery display
3. Transfer to computer and verify with desktop image/video viewers

## Success Metrics

- [ ] App builds and runs on Android
- [ ] Camera permissions granted and handled gracefully
- [ ] All three camera modes functional
- [ ] Photos captured with correct EXIF orientation
- [ ] Videos captured with correct rotation metadata
- [ ] Media displays correctly in native gallery apps
- [ ] App handles lifecycle transitions without crashes
- [ ] Comprehensive test data collected from multiple devices
