# Permission Race Condition Fix

## Problem Description

On some Android devices (specifically reported on Pixel 8 Pro), there was a race condition between permission granting and camera initialization. The issue manifested as:

1. User grants camera and microphone permissions via dialog
2. App immediately tries to initialize camera
3. Permission check returns `false` even though user just granted permissions
4. Camera screen shows black screen with permission error
5. Going back and re-entering camera screen works (permissions now properly reflected)

## Root Cause

The race condition occurs because:
- Android permission system has a slight delay between dialog dismissal and permission status update
- App immediately checks permissions after dialog closes
- `Permission.camera.status` and `Permission.microphone.status` may still return old values
- Camera initialization fails with "permissions required" error

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Retry Mechanism in Permission Service

Added `hasAllCameraPermissionsWithRetry()` method that:
- Retries permission checks up to 3 times
- Uses exponential backoff delays (100ms, 200ms, 300ms)
- Returns `true` as soon as permissions are detected
- Only returns `false` after all retries exhausted

```dart
Future<bool> hasAllCameraPermissionsWithRetry({
  int maxAttempts = 3,
  Duration delay = const Duration(milliseconds: 100),
}) async {
  for (int attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    final hasPermissions = await hasAllCameraPermissions();
    if (hasPermissions) {
      return true;
    }
    
    if (attempt < maxAttempts - 1) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: delay.inMilliseconds * (attempt + 1)));
    }
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

### 2. Updated Camera Initialization

Modified `CameraController._initializeCamera()` to:
- Use retry mechanism instead of single permission check
- Handle race condition gracefully
- Provide better error states

### 3. Enhanced Navigation Flow

Updated `HomeScreen._navigateToCameraMode()` to:
- Add 150ms delay after permission request
- Use retry mechanism for permission verification
- Only navigate when permissions confirmed

### 4. Improved Camera Screen State Management

Enhanced `CameraScreen` to:
- Track initialization failure state
- Provide retry functionality
- Show appropriate UI for different states
- Handle permission state changes

## Testing

Created comprehensive integration tests that:
- Simulate race condition behavior
- Verify retry mechanism works
- Test different attempt counts
- Validate permission flow timing

## Device-Specific Behavior

The fix addresses variations between devices:
- **Pixel 8**: Faster permission status updates (no race condition)
- **Pixel 8 Pro**: Slower permission status updates (race condition present)
- **Other devices**: May have similar timing variations

## Usage

The fix is automatic and transparent to users:
1. User grants permissions via dialog
2. App automatically retries permission checks
3. Camera initializes successfully once permissions detected
4. No user intervention required

## Performance Impact

Minimal performance impact:
- Maximum 600ms additional delay in worst case (3 retries Ã— 200ms average)
- Only occurs during initial permission grant
- Subsequent app launches skip retry logic (permissions already granted)
- No impact on normal camera operation

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Listen to permission status changes via streams
- Device-specific retry timing based on manufacturer
- Fallback to manual permission check button
- Analytics to track race condition frequency by device model
