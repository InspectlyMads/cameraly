# Cameraly Package Restructuring Summary

This document summarizes the restructuring of the cameraly package to follow the standard Flutter package structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Files Moved to Root
- Moved `/packages/cameraly/lib/` → `/lib/`
- Moved `/packages/cameraly/test/` → `/test/`
- Moved `/packages/cameraly/pubspec.yaml` → `/pubspec.yaml`
- Moved `/packages/cameraly/README.md` → `/README.md`
- Moved `/packages/cameraly/LICENSE` → `/LICENSE`
- Moved `/packages/cameraly/CHANGELOG.md` → `/CHANGELOG.md`
- Moved `/packages/cameraly/docs/` → `/docs/`
- Copied additional documentation files (API_REFERENCE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, QUICK_START.md)

### 2. Example App Restructured
- Moved the root app to `/example/`
- Updated `/example/pubspec.yaml` to reference the parent package with `path: ../`
- Removed duplicate dependencies from example that are provided by the package
- Fixed Android package name from `com.example.cameraly` to `com.example.cameraly_example`
- Updated Android app label to "Cameraly Example"

### 3. File Structure
The new structure follows the standard Flutter package layout:

```
/cameraly (repository root)
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── pubspec.yaml
├── analysis_options.yaml
├── .gitignore
├── lib/
│   └── cameraly.dart (and all package source files)
├── test/
│   └── (package tests)
├── docs/
│   └── (package documentation)
└── example/
    ├── pubspec.yaml
    ├── README.md
    ├── lib/
    │   └── main.dart
    └── (platform-specific directories)
```

### 4. Clean Up
- Removed the `/packages/` directory
- Removed duplicate documentation from the old root
- Updated `.gitignore` to use the package-level gitignore

## Next Steps

1. Run `flutter pub get` in both the root and example directories
2. Test that the example app still builds and runs correctly
3. Update any CI/CD configurations that may reference the old structure
4. Update the repository's homepage and repository URLs in pubspec.yaml
5. Commit these changes to the `restructure-package` branch
6. Create a pull request to merge into main

## Benefits

- Standard Flutter package structure makes it easier to publish to pub.dev
- Clear separation between the package and example app
- Better organization for contributors and users
- Follows Flutter community conventions
