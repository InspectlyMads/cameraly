## Areas Still Needing Tests

1. Services:
   - CameraService
   - MediaService
   - MetadataService
   - PermissionService
   - CameraInfoService
   - CameraUIService
   - MemoryManager

2. Providers:
   - CameraProviders
   - PermissionProviders

3. Widgets:
   - CameraScreen
   - CameraGridOverlay
   - CountdownWidget
   - FocusIndicator
   - CameraZoomControl

4. Models:

These would require more complex test setups with mocking of Flutter widgets and platform channels.
